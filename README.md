# python-scripts

In this repository, there are scripts I have created that run various tasks using Python.

<hr/>

<b>File-Check.py:</b> This python script runs a check on a directory and its working tree,<br/>
then runs a check on those files to see if they have been within the directory for more than a specified time,<br/>
if they are, log this info to a file in a basic fashion.

<hr/>

<h2>Run a script as a service:</h2>
To run any script as a service/daemon in a linux machine,<br/>
I attached a mock service file that must be added into your systemd file system<br/>
to run this script in the background, configure the file as needed.
